## Beans are in both JDK and JRE

Beans are a class in the **java.beans** package that provide some general purpose methods for JavaBeans[^1^][1]. JavaBeans are reusable software components that can be manipulated visually in a builder tool[^1^][1].

JDK stands for **Java Development Kit**. It is a software development environment that contains the JRE, the Java compiler, and other tools for developing Java applications[^2^][2].

JRE stands for **Java Runtime Environment**. It is a software package that contains the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Java Class Library, and other components needed to run Java programs[^2^][2].

Both JDK and JRE contain beans, but JDK also contains tools to create and manipulate beans. If you want to develop Java applications that use beans, you need JDK. If you only want to run Java applications that use beans, you need JRE.

I hope this helps. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.ðŸ˜Š
